# CassyHub
A solution for Content as a Service that integrates into your websites. CassyHub allows content editors and publishers to create their content in a simple and easy to use cloud based environment. Developers can then directly integrate the content into websites or other systems, letting the content editors maintain control over content while developer focus on system functionality.
